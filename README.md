Title: On some recent developments in topology optimization of aerostructures {Stiffer, Lighter, Greener}
Prof. Joseph Morlier, ISAE-SUPAEO/ICA {Visiting prof Kunal Masania at TU Delft May 2022}

The goal of this presentation is to present two innovative numerical methods for designing ultralightweight structures.
This presentation attempts to demonstrate the contribution of reproducible research with two recent attempts of Prof Morlierâ€™s group untitled GGP [1] and EMTO [2]. The first method standardizes the existing methods in explicit topological optimization. The second offers a multiscale topological optimization environment. The common point: Two pioneering work on SIMP published with the associated Matlab code top99 and top88 (initiative of the DTU). The comparison of these methods will be applied to an airplane wing rib (2D). We highlight here their complementarity, one giving a crystal clear structural concept, the other one giving a micro-architectural design whose manufacture must be automated (using 3D printer). A panorama of more advanced results in Pylon design [3] and ALM [4] will be highlighted for GGP. Finally, a brief introduction to Ecodesign with SIMP topology optimization will also be presented [5].
